# HighSchoolMascotMap
Host the style file and icons for an Ultra based mascot map.

You can view the map from [this link](https://overpass-ultra.us/#query=url:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/watmildon/HighSchoolMascotMap/refs/heads/main/HSMascotMap.ultra).

# Adding icons
I would love help sourcing icons and adding them to the repo and map. The current requirements are:

* Black and white 64x64 pixel png
* Suitable lisence, ex: public domain, or attributed in icon-info.md

Once we have a suitable icon, add it to HSMascotMap.ultra under the other icons. Remember to leave the last entry as a blank string so that the green dot shows.

If you need inspiration on what to look for, [TagInfo](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/mascot#values) has a full listing of values.
