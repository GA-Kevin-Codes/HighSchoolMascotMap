# HighSchoolMascotMap
This repo hosts the style file and icons for an [Ultra](https://overpass-ultra.us/) based mascot map. You can view the map from [this link](https://overpass-ultra.us/#map&query=url:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/watmildon/HighSchoolMascotMap/refs/heads/main/HSMascotMap.ultra).

# Adding mascot data
All map information comes from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). The mascot key is [documented on the OSM Wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:mascot). If you know the mascot for a local school, please feel free to add it to the database!

I am also running a set of [MapRoulette](https://maproulette.org/) tasks that help coordinate and organize mapping of this type. You can find them in the [HighSchoolTagging project](https://maproulette.org/browse/projects/59042).

# Adding icons
I would love help sourcing icons and adding them to the repo and map. The current requirements are:

* Black and white 64x64 pixel png
* Suitable license, ex: public domain, or attributed in icon-info.md

Once you have a suitable icon, add it to HSMascotMap.ultra under the other icons. The last entry is the defaul school icon.

If you need inspiration on what values still need icons, [TagInfo](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/keys/mascot#values) has a full listing of values.
